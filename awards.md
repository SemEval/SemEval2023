# SemEval-2023: Best Task, Best Paper!!

[SemEval-2023](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2023/) features two overall awards, one for organizers of a task and one for a team participating in a task.

We are very pleased to announce the winners of these awards for SemEval-2023!

## Best Task Paper Award

The Best Task Paper award, for organizers of an individual shared task,
recognizes a task that stands out for making an important intellectual contribution to empirical computational semantics,
as demonstrated by a creative, interesting, and scientifically rigorous dataset and evaluation design,
and a well-written task overview paper.

### [Best Task Paper: SemEval-2023 Task 10: Explainable Detection of Online Sexism](https://aclanthology.org/2023.semeval-1.305/)<br>_Hannah Kirk, Wenjie Yin, Bertie Vidgen, Paul Röttger_

#### [Honorable Mention: SemEval-2023 Task 5: Clickbait Spoiling](https://aclanthology.org/2023.semeval-1.312/)<br>_Maik Fröbe, Benno Stein, Tim Gollub, Matthias Hagen, Martin Potthast_

#### [Honorable Mention: SemEval-2023 Task 7: Multi-Evidence Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trial Data](https://aclanthology.org/2023.semeval-1.307/)<br>_Maël Jullien, Marco Valentino, Hannah Frost, Paul O’regan, Donal Landers, André Freitas_


## Best System Paper Award

The Best System Paper award, for task participants,
recognizes a system description paper that advances our understanding of a problem
and available solutions with respect to a task.
It need not be the highest-scoring system in the task,
but it must have a strong analysis component in the evaluation,
as well as a clear and reproducible description of the problem, algorithms, and methodology.
